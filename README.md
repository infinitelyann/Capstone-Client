 ### As a user, I want to be able to...
    - sign-in/sign-up for application
    - create a creative profile given 'theme' options
    - edit/update/delete my profile at any time
    - create a text-post in which:
            - I can edit, update, and delete 
            - I can use "tags" to categorize my posts, and to see others posts
            - I can like/dislike  posts (UpVote/DownVote)
    - see posts from other users if not logged in
    - not be able to interact with posts until logged in 
    - get points for interacting with others posts by:
            - comment on other peoples posts
            - like/dislike comments
            - edit/delete comment
    - look at different 'tags' other people have used, and browse posts w/ that tag
